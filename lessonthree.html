                  <strong>Landfall</strong> is an event where tropical cyclones
                  move towards land after staying over bodies of water. PAGASA
                  releases <strong>public storm warning signals</strong> in
                  different areas of the country. The warning signals are put in
                  effect before the onset of the meteorological condition. This
                  is done to warn the people of a certain locality of the
                  potential wind speed and strength of the typhoon. Public storm
                  warning signals are numbered one to five depending on the wind
                  speed and its impact.

                  earlier, the country experiences an average of 20 typhoons in
                  a year where most of which greatly caused severe damage. With
                  this, it is very essential to know the actions to be
                  implemented in order to be prepared in such calamity.

                    Different types of homes would mean different hazards to
                    experience during typhoons. People living in temporary
                    structures or mobile homes are prone to hazards no matter
                    how fastened the homes are to the ground. High-rise
                    buildings will experience strong winds. It may help if
                    people would move on or below the 10th floor. If you live in
                    a house built near coasts expect storm surge.

                    A storm surge is a phenomenon where water piles up along a
                    coastline due to low pressure and strong winds. If you
                    happen to live near coastlines, take shelter in places
                    farther from the sea. In the case of threat of storm surge,
                    evacuate in places higher than 500 meters from the bay area.

                    Make sure that house is stable after a typhoon. Wait for the
                    announcement of the government agency that it is safe to
                    return to the house. Aside from PAGASA, the National
                    Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (NDRMMC) is the
                    government agency mandated to provide necessary information
                    and implement plans which could help people to be prepared
                    and to respond to numerous natural calamities such as
                    earthquakes and typhoons. NDRRMC disseminates information
                    through several means. For instance, it sends SMS messages
                    to give flood warning signals to the people who are in the
                    affected areas.

                    After the typhoon and provided that it is safe to the area
                    nearby the house, make necessary repairs to your house.
                    Report damaged electric lines and posts. Clean your
                    surroundings. Check if someone from your family or
